                <p>According to Strange and Banning (2015), the structural or organizational environment encompasses "the policies, practices, and procedures that shape how the organization operates and influences human behavior within it" (p. 112). A well-designed structural environment should be flexible, promote innovation, and actively engage students as meaningful participants while maintaining accountability and human-scale design (Strange & Banning, 2015, p. 112). Union Street Center (USC), as one of the 19 residence halls at Indiana University Bloomington (IUB), reflects many of these principles while also presenting unique challenges due to its apartment-style design and predominantly upperclass resident population.</p>

            <h2>Organizational Structure and Reporting Lines</h2>
            
            <p>USC operates under the Central East neighborhood, which includes Eigenmann Hall, Tulip Tree Apartments, Campus View Apartments, Third and Union, and Wilkie Residence Center. Within this structure, I report directly to the Residence Life Coordinator for Student Development (RLC-SD), who oversees the professional development of graduate assistants and resident assistants and reports to the Assistant Director for Apartment Housing.</p>
            
            <div class="organizational-chart">
                <h4>Evolution of Reporting Structure</h4>
                <p>This reporting line has evolved over time: when USC was previously classified strictly as a dormitory, the RLC-SD reported to a Residence Manager; the shift toward apartment-style housing has allowed for a more direct supervisory relationship with the Assistant Director. The RLC-SD collaborates closely with the Residence Life Coordinator for Operations (RLC-O), who manages the Center Desk staff, coordinates facilities needs, and ensures logistical support for programming. This shared leadership model ensures that operational and developmental priorities are aligned and that all staff members have clear guidance and accountability.</p>

            <h2>Staffing Structure and Supervision</h2>
            
            <div class="staff-structure">
                <h4>USC Staffing Hierarchy</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Assistant Director for Apartment Housing</strong> - Overall oversight</li>
                    <li><strong>Residence Life Coordinator for Student Development (RLC-SD)</strong> - Graduate assistant supervision</li>
                    <li><strong>Residence Life Coordinator for Operations (RLC-O)</strong> - Center Desk and facilities</li>
                    <li><strong>Graduate Assistants (2)</strong> - Direct RA supervision</li>
                    <li><strong>Resident Assistants (20)</strong> - Student staff, split evenly between graduate assistants</li>
                    <li><strong>Emergency Operations Team</strong> - Safety and logistics support</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>The staffing structure at USC consists of 20 Resident Assistants, split evenly between two graduate assistants. Each RA is assigned to a specific apartment hall or section, and the RAs report directly to their supervising graduate assistant. Professional student staff, including those from the IU Emergency Operations team, work in close coordination with Residence Life to support student safety, logistics, and programming needs. This chain of supervision is clear and efficient, providing both RAs and graduate assistants with consistent guidance and fostering a culture of accountability and support.</p>

                <h4>Multi-Level Communication Structure</h4>
                <p>Communication within USC is strong and multifaceted. Weekly leadership team meetings take place in-person in the RLC-SD office and include the two graduate assistants, the RLC-SD, the RLC-O, and the Assistant Director for Apartment Housing. Additionally, bi-weekly small staff meetings connect graduate assistants with their assigned RAs, and bi-weekly larger staff meetings include the full RA team. Microsoft Teams and shared email chains provide supplementary platforms for coordination, ensuring that both day-to-day operational needs and strategic planning are consistently communicated across staff levels.</p>

            <h2>Innovation and Flexible Programming</h2>
            
            <p>USC actively encourages innovation and flexible programming within its structural framework. Graduate assistants and RAs are empowered to design and implement creative events and programs, including movie nights, karaoke nights, line dancing, bonfire events, and neighborhood block parties.</p>
            
            <div class="innovation-section">
                <h4>Programming Support Structure</h4>
                <p>The RLC-SD reviews program proposals, while the RLC-O ensures the necessary space and logistical support are in place. While institutional policies regarding materials or budgets can sometimes limit the scope of programming, the structural environment remains generally supportive of innovation. Additionally, staff are encouraged to gather resident feedback through surveys and informal check-ins, providing a reflective loop that informs future programming decisions and strengthens resident engagement.</p>

            <h2>Challenges and Limitations</h2>
            
            <div class="challenge-section">
                <h4>Apartment-Style Housing Challenges</h4>
                <p>Despite these strengths, USC faces challenges inherent to apartment-style housing. Residents primarily occupy private bedrooms and apartments, which can reduce incidental interactions and make participation in community events difficult. Upperclass and continuing students, who comprise the majority of the population, are often focused on academics or personal schedules, resulting in lower attendance at events compared to first-year students. Staff efforts, including RA outreach and structured programming, aim to mitigate these barriers by connecting students to campus resources and encouraging community involvement through initiatives like monthly bulletin boards and neighborhood programming.</p>

                <h3>Overall Assessment</h3>
                <p>Overall, the structural environment at USC fosters a culture of support, professionalism, and collaboration. Graduate assistants and RAs benefit from clear reporting lines, consistent mentorship, and opportunities to innovate within established parameters. Residents benefit from attentive supervision, accessible programming, and connections to broader campus resources. While challenges related to engagement and apartment-style independence remain, the organizational framework provides a strong foundation for both staff and student success. Aligning with Strange and Banning's (2015) principles, USC demonstrates that structure, when paired with flexibility, mentorship, and clear communication, can create an environment where both staff and students thrive.</p>
